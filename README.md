# Crime Map and Restful Server

This is the code for a Single Page Application that gives raw data of crimes filed in St. Paul as well as a map that displays them. To use it you can download 
the repository and after you install the node dependencies you should be able to run the server on your local host. For instructions on how to use the app in
detail please consult the mp4 file "St Paul Crime Map" within this Repository.
